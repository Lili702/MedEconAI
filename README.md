# Economic Implications of AI-Driven Medical Image Analysis in Healthcare Systems

## Overview

This repository contains research and implementation details for the project **"Economic Implications of AI-Driven Medical Image Analysis in Healthcare Systems."** The project explores the economic effects of AI adoption in medical imaging, focusing on cost-effectiveness, reimbursement models, and resource allocation. 

We introduce the **Dynamic Healthcare Economic Framework (DHEF)**, which integrates agent-based modeling, reinforcement learning, and game-theoretic principles to analyze the interactions between AI, healthcare providers, insurers, and policymakers. Our simulations provide insights into pricing strategies, reimbursement policies, and investment decisions for AI-driven medical imaging.
